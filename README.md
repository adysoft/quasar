# Quasar
This is a very rough GUI I quickly put together to download screenshots from Resetera and Neogaf threads.

By default, it will not work.

You need to edit the settings.xml file, and enter a valid directory (RootDirectory) for each screenshot thread.

These directories don't actually need to exist, Quasar will create them if they don't, but they need to be on a valid drive.
I save screenshots on F:\ but you might not have an F:\ drive, so that's the important part to edit.
Same idea with the TempFolder field, it must be an existing folder on your computer.

Then, all you have to do is start Quasar, and click on the "Sync" button.
